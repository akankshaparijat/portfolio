                <h11><b>Overview</b></h11>
                <br>
                <p5>The Sustainable Travel Planner application is a user-friendly platform that allows individuals to create personalized travel plans while prioritizing low carbon footprint. By leveraging GEN-AI technology, the application offers tailored recommendations for destinations, transportation options, accommodations, and activities, ensuring an enjoyable travel experience with minimal environmental impact.</p5>                
                <br><br>
                <h11><b>Background</b></h11>
                <br>
                <p5>Traditional travel planning often overlooks the ecological consequences of tourism. As the demand for sustainable travel grows, there is a need for a comprehensive solution that integrates carbon-conscious decision-making into the travel planning process. The Sustainable Travel Planner application aims to address this gap by combining user preferences and GEN-AI to optimize travel plans with reduced carbon emissions.</p5>               
                <br><br>
                <h11><b>My Contribution</b></h11>
                <br>
                <p5>As the lead designer of the Sustainable Travel Planner application, my role involved conceptualizing, designing, and overseeing the development of the user interface and experience. I collaborated closely with a cross-functional team of developers, researchers, and domain experts to ensure the application's effectiveness and usability.</p5>                
                <br><br>
                <h11><b>Research</b></h11>
                <br>
                <p5>During the research phase, several key findings emerged regarding space tourism to Mars. While the application primarily focuses on Earth-bound travel, understanding the emerging field of space tourism is crucial to future-proof the platform. Key findings included the potential environmental impact of space tourism, the anticipated technological advancements in space travel, and the evolving market landscape.</p5>                
                <br><br>
                <h11><b>Problem Statement</b></h11>
                <br>
                <p5>The lack of readily available information and tools to help travelers create sustainable travel plans tailored to their preferences is a significant challenge. Existing travel planning platforms often prioritize convenience over environmental considerations, leading to increased carbon emissions. The goal is to develop an application that seamlessly integrates personal preferences with carbon footprint management, promoting sustainable travel choices.</p5>                
                <br><br>
                <h11><b>Target Audience</b></h11>
                <br>
                <p5>The Sustainable Travel Planner application targets environmentally conscious travelers who value personalized experiences without compromising their commitment to reducing carbon emissions. This includes both leisure travelers and business professionals seeking to align their travel plans with their sustainability goals.</p5>                
                <br><br>
                <h11><b>Ideation</b></h11>
                <br>
                <p5>During the ideation phase, various concepts were explored to integrate the application's core functionalities effectively. Brainstorming sessions and user feedback were used to refine ideas and prioritize features that align with user needs and preferences while considering carbon reduction.</p5>
